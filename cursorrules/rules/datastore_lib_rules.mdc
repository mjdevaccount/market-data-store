# Rule: Datastore Library (Control Plane)
SCOPE
- Control-plane library for migrations, policies, and admin operations.
- Provides scaffolding for writes/reads/idempotency; no bulk data operations.

REQUIREMENTS
- Create connection helpers, session management (async or sync), and placeholders:
  - writes.py: upsert/batch placeholders, no-op bodies.
  - reads.py: tiny ops helpers only for tests.
  - idempotency.py: key builders, conflict strategies (stubs).
- Document public functions with docstrings and expected contracts.
- Focus on control-plane operations, not bulk data processing.

NOTE
- For bulk data operations, use mds_client library instead.
- This library is for admin/control operations, not data ingestion.

CONTEXT
- @reference src/datastore/{writes.py,reads.py,idempotency.py,config.py}
- @reference cursorrules/rules/mds_client_library.mdc for data operations
