# Rule: Datastore Library
SCOPE
- Provide lib scaffolding for future writes/reads/idempotency; no real DDL yet.

REQUIREMENTS
- Create connection helpers, session management (async or sync), and placeholders:
  - writes.py: upsert/batch placeholders, no-op bodies.
  - reads.py: tiny ops helpers only for tests.
  - idempotency.py: key builders, conflict strategies (stubs).
- Document public functions with docstrings and expected contracts.

CONTEXT
- @reference src/datastore/{writes.py,reads.py,idempotency.py,config.py}
