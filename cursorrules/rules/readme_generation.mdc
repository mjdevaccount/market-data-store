# README Generation Rules

## Auto-Generation Prompt
When the user requests README updates or folder structure changes, automatically regenerate the "📂 Project Layout & Description" section with:

1. **Logical Groupings**: Organize into Infra & Ops, Schema & Migrations, Service Layer, Automation Rules
2. **Clickable Links**: Use markdown links for all file/directory references in navigation
3. **Emoji Usage**: Consistent emojis for visual hierarchy (🏗️ 🗄️ 🚀 🤖 🧭)
4. **Navigation Guide**: Include practical "How to Navigate" with direct file links
5. **Cursor Integration**: Always mention /cursorrules/ as Cursor's home base

## Format Template
```markdown
## 📂 Project Layout & Description

This repository is structured as a **control-plane** with clear separation between infrastructure, schema management, service layer, and automation rules.

Below is a snapshot of the repo's structure with logical groupings to help new contributors and automation tools (like Cursor) navigate effectively.

### 🏗️ **Infra & Ops**
[Directory tree with inline comments]

### 🗄️ **Schema & Migrations**
[Directory tree with inline comments]

### 🚀 **Service Layer**
[Directory tree with inline comments]

### 🤖 **Automation Rules**
[Directory tree with inline comments]

### 🧭 **How to Navigate**

🗄️ **DB Migrations** → [`/migrations/versions/`](migrations/versions/)
🚀 **Admin Endpoints** → [`/src/datastore/service/app.py`](src/datastore/service/app.py)
[Additional navigation items with clickable links]

> **Cursor**: You can regenerate this section automatically whenever the folder structure changes. The `/cursorrules/` directory is your home base for self-bootstrapping rules and automation.
```

## Auto-Detection Triggers
- Folder structure changes
- New files added to src/datastore/
- Changes to cursorrules/ directory
- User requests README updates
- Project layout modifications

## Self-Bootstrap Instructions
When regenerating, always:
1. Scan current directory structure
2. Categorize files into logical groups
3. Generate clickable markdown links
4. Include practical navigation guide
5. Add Cursor regeneration note
