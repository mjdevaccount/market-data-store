# Always-Active Rules (market-data-store)
SCOPE
- This repo is a data-store control-plane: FastAPI admin endpoints, Alembic migrations, policies, CLI, metrics.
- Includes mds_client library: Production-ready client for Market Data Core with sync/async APIs, batch processing, backup/restore.
- No bulk data plane here. Orchestrator writes via the datastore library; readers go direct DB or separate analytics API.

BOUNDARIES
- Do not create business tables without explicit instruction.
- Control-plane endpoints: health, readiness, schema/version, migrate, retention/compression, aggregate refresh, backfills, metrics.
- Auth: mutating endpoints must support X-Admin-Token.

CONTEXT INJECTION
- Inject only assets referenced by the task. Never dump entire files.
- Inject order: core config â†’ mds_client library â†’ datastore library â†’ service â†’ migrations â†’ tests.
- Prefer @reference with small, targeted snippets.
- Always reference database_schema.mdc for schema, CLI, and migration details.
- For mds_client tasks, reference mds_client_library.mdc for client API details.

STYLE
- Python 3.11, FastAPI, Typer, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Alembic, psycopg 3, psycopg_pool.
- Line length: 100 characters (enforced by Black/Ruff).
- Keep modules cohesive, small, and documented with a top docstring.
- Log with loguru; expose Prometheus metrics; add type hints.
- Use pydantic BaseSettings for configuration.
- mds_client: Use psycopg 3 + psycopg_pool for connection pooling, Pydantic v2 models.

ENVIRONMENT
- Always activate virtual environment: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
- Load .env file for environment variables before running scripts.
- Use PowerShell syntax for all terminal commands.

GUARDRAILS
- No destructive SQL or DDL unless explicitly asked.
- Keep rule files â‰¤ 60 lines; keep prompts terse; reuse vocabulary from this file.

README GENERATION
- Auto-regenerate "ðŸ“‚ Project Layout & Description" section when folder structure changes.
- Use logical groupings: Infra & Ops, Schema & Migrations, Service Layer, Automation Rules.
- Include clickable markdown links for all file/directory references.
- Add practical navigation guide with emojis and direct file links.
- Always mention /cursorrules/ as Cursor's home base for self-bootstrapping.
